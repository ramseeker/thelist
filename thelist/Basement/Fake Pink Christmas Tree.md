Normal families might have real green [Christmas](Fake%2520Pink%2520Christmas%2520Tree.md##christmas) tree or even a [green artificial tree](https://amzn.to/3x58hft), but nope - not us. The wife has decided that we need to have one that's [bright pink!](https://amzn.to/3VwNkUU)  
  
Artificial trees have come a long way and they don't really look that bad and in the long run it's better for nature and my wallet as it's easy to spend over $100 on a real tree.  
  
It goes up easily and goes down easily so there's less work and  less mess and I am all about that.
